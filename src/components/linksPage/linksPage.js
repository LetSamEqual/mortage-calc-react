            <p>

            <h3>Conveyancer vs Solicitor</h3>
            <b>Conveyancers</b>
            <p>
              Conveyancers prepare and review all the transfer documentation,
              conduct title and certificate searches, communicate with the
              vendor on your behalf and help you deal with any issues that might
              arise throughout the transfer process. They are generally very
              well versed in local laws and procedures. Conveyancers can be less
              expensive than qualified solicitors, making them an excellent
              choice for straightforward property transactions.
            </p>
            <b>Solicitor</b>
            <p>
              As opposed to a conveyancer, a solicitor is a fully fledged legal
              professional. They do the same tasks as a conveyancer (in fact, in
              this role, they are conveyancers), but they have a greater
              knowledge of the law. They are more equipped to deal with
              complicated or out-of-the-ordinary issues or complex sales. And
              they can advise you on difficult matters, such as tax
              implications.
            </p>

            <p>
              Another important difference is that a solicitor can act on
              property transactions Australia wide, not specific to the state
              that their certificate was received. Conveyancers are only
              permitted to transact in the state that they are licensed.
            </p>

          <h2 className="linkContainerHeading">Lenders mortage insurance</h2>
          <div className="linksContainer">
            <p>
              When borrowing more than 80 per cent of a property’s value, it is
              generally a condition of the loan that the borrower pays Lenders
              Mortgage Insurance (LMI).
            </p>
            <p>
              One method to avoid paying LMI is to save up the minimum deposit
              for the property purchase. Alternatively, if your deposit is less
              than 20 per cent but you have a guarantor for the property loan,
              you may be able to avoid paying LMI. Your guarantor can assist by
              providing additional security which reduces the Loan to Value
              Ratio (LVR) to 80 per cent and therefore enables you to avoid
              paying LMI.
            </p>
            <p>
              If LMI is added to your loan amount, your minimum monthly mortgage
              repayments will marginally increase to cover the cost of LMI.
            </p>
